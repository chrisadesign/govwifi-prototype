    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">

      <p>This fork has a versioning system built in, which allows you to create a feature &ndash; these can be any structure you want, for example you might organise by hypotheses or sprints &ndash; which then has as many versions of that thing as you need.</p>



      <h2 id="structure" class="govuk-heading-m">How the folders are structured</h2>

      <p>There is an <code>example-feature</code> folder within <code>views</code>. In there is an index page which acts as the changelog for each feature. There is also a <code>v1</code> folder which has an example question page and a <code>_routes.js</code> file; each version of a feature has it&rsquo;s own routes file.<p>

      <img src="/public/images/versioning-system-folder-structure.png" alt="Screenshot of the folder structure" style="max-width: 300px;">

      <p>Each feature folder sits in the views folder. Versions within a feature must be a number prefixed with a &lsquo;v&rsquo;, for example &lsquo;v12&rsquo;.</p>

      <p>Routes are controlled per version of a feature, the main <code>routes.js</code> file in views imports the version routes as long as the folder structure is followed.</p>







      <h2 id="new" class="govuk-heading-m">How to create a new feature</h2>
      <p>When you start on a new feature all you need to do is dupliacte the <code>example-feature</code> folder and rename it.</p>

      <p>When you need a new version you can duplicate the <code>v1</code> folder and link to it from the index/changelog page.</p>
